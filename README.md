# Defi Principal — React App (Vite)

This workspace contains a minimal React application scaffolded with Vite.

Quick start

- **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

- **Run development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

- **Build for production:**

```bash
npm run build
```

- **Preview production build:**

```bash
npm run preview
```

Project structure

- `index.html` — app entry HTML
- `vite.config.js` — Vite configuration
- `package.json` — scripts and dependencies
- `src/main.jsx` — application bootstrap
- `src/App.jsx` — top-level React component
- `src/index.css` — basic styles

Notes

- This project uses Vite and the official React plugin. If you prefer `yarn` or `pnpm`, substitute the package manager commands accordingly.
- To install dependencies and run the dev server on your machine:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\aniso\OneDrive\Bureau\defi principal"
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you'd like TypeScript, routing, or additional tooling (ESLint, Prettier), tell me and I can add them.
